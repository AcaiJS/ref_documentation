	"DESCRIPTION": "Açaí was born from the principle that everything should be easy, even programming. So our main goal was to make a simple framework that was easy to use, but did not sacrifice good practices, perfomance nor organization. You can have everything at your hand and exchange each and every part easily. But you may ask yourself right now, where this weird name I never heard of before?"
